This is a Repository of Scratch Games, There aren't a lot of them but there a couple in here. All of the pdf's (except for one of them) are in there. 

Q&A

Why did I do this? Well I did this because I had nothing else to do so I decided to release these for people who are interested in learning scratch, 
and because I just had them lying around (My teacher Assigned me the work, I did these on the side of my main project, Which I might post on here).

Are we allowed to post them on scratch? I would recommend if you want to post them to just mention the creator in there. You don't need to credit me or my repo.
